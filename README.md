# ECE-345
ECE 345 Project - Web app.

This is Where we can do all of our developement and stay up-to-date with this project. It will make it easier to hand off as well at the end of the year. 

Make sure to review how to use Git <- it is a super tool.> I would like to use git hub, because there are a lot of really awesome tools that we can use. to make this project easier. 

Lets use an agile method to create this project. and do a good job at it. I think that this can help all of us.
